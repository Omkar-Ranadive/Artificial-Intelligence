# Explanation: 
## Eight Puzzle
* File name - eightPuzzle.java
* An eight puzzle solver. There are six different searching algorithms in the .java file which can be used to solve the eight puzzle problem. They are as follows: 
    * Uninformed Search Strategies: 
        * Breadth First Search (BFS) 
        * Depth First Search (DFS) 
        * Depth-limited Search (DLS)
        * Iterative deepening DFS 
    * Informed search strategies 
        * Greedy BFS 
        * A* Search 
* Usage: 
    * Select one of the six functions (bfs(), dfs(), ids(), dls(), greedyBFS(), astart())
    * Enter initial state and goal state 

## N-Queens using uninformed search 
* File name - UninformedSearch.java	
* N-queen solver using uninformed search strategies - BFS, DFS, DLS IDS 
* Usage - Uncomment the desired search strategy in the main() function 

## Tic Tac Toe using Min Max 
* File name - minMax.java
* An interactive command line tic tac toe game. The AI agent plays perfectly using the min-max algorithm 
* Usage - Run the .java file and play interactively 

## Genetic Algorithm 
* File name - geneticAlgo.java 
* Genetic algorithm solution for Knapsack 0/1 problem 
* Usage - Enter number of items, weight and value of each item and the total weight of the bag
